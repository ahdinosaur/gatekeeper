# nongrata

This is the live coding site for the Clojure Minnesota 5/2 meeting to better 
understand Persona (BrowserID) and Clojure / Clojurescript (with Noir).

Persona (BrowserID) aims to be a better, more usable and more privacy-conscious
implementation of OpenID. You can find out more at [BrowserID Project Documentation at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/BrowserID#The_BrowserID_Project)

Clojurescript event handling is another topic this is trying to address here. 
* Setting up with Clojurescript with the [Clojurescript quick start](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/wiki/Quick-Start)
* Dom manipulation samples [Can be found here](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/samples/dom/src/dom/test.cljs)
* Although this is not following the approach of CJS1, it's worth it to take a look at the [Clojurescript One Documentation](http://clojurescriptone.com/documentation.html)
* More about event handling can be found at the [Clojurescript One Event Handling docs] (https://github.com/brentonashworth/one/wiki/Event-dispatching).
* Using [Clojurescript with Noir](http://www.chris-granger.com/2012/02/20/overtone-and-clojurescript/)

Finally, [Noir](https://github.com/ibdknox/webnoir) is [Chris Granger's](https://github.com/ibdknox) web development library which uses Ring and Compojure.
